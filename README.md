# CartPole
This repository contains an AGENT - being the TensorFlow model of Sutton's REINFORCE algorithm "REINFORCE_Morss.py", a CartPole ENVIRONMENT modeled in MATLAB/Simulink and an m-file "pendemosimscript.m" that (re)starts the simulation each episode.

The CartPole model in Simulink is an extension of the Simulink example "penddemo": https://de.mathworks.com/help/simulink/examples/inverted-pendulum-with-animation.html with added TCP/IP socket blocks.

Code is written in Python 3 and Matlab 2017b.
