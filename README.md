# CartPole
This repository contains the TensorFlow model of Sutton's REINFORCE algorithm applied to a CartPole environment modeled in MATLAB/Simulink and an m-file "pendemosimscript.m" to start the simulation.
The CartPole model in Simulink is an extension of the Simulink example "penddemo": https://de.mathworks.com/help/simulink/examples/inverted-pendulum-with-animation.html with added TCP/IP socket blocks.

Code is written in Python 3 and Matlab 2017b.
